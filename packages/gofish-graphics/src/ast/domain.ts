 *  old `scaleFactor`); `map` is the anchored map of the axis's POSITION scope
 *  (the old `posScale`), and `map.sigma` is that scope's σ. Both are registry-
 *  solved — no site fabricates either — so when both are present and `sigma ≠

 *  ticks map the NICED domain while its bars size the UN-niced total, or a
